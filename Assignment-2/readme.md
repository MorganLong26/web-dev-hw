## Work Cycle
For this assignment I went throught all of the tabs on the courses website. I watched the videos and followed along with the examples. I learned several new things, such as, how we send via the internet, what version control is, what cookies are, ect.

I didn't struggle that much with this assignment. I found that if you go through all of the tabs of information and all of the examples you will be fine. If I had any questions the follow along examples helped. I didn't post any issues on the repo issue because I was able to figure out the problem.
