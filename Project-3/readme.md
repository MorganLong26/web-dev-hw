# Final README.MD

Padding is the space around an elements content, inside of the defined borders. Margin is the area between the content on the page and the edge of the page. A border can be any design around a specific element such as a solid line, dotted, or dashed.

The hardest task for me was overlapping elements. It was some what confusing but I got the idea and positioning was also difficult. I had to reference the course website several times and google examples of how to position objects in css. I was able to wrap my head around the concept eventually.

For this project I wanted to create a design that resembled me. I love clean simplistic designs that are black and white with a pop of color. For this assignment I chose pink for the pop up color with a dotted border because I love poka-dots. For the picture I chose a film strip and had it on both sides of my links to my previous Assignments. I chose film strip because I am such a movie lover that I had to incorporate movies somehow.

## Work Cycle
- I first began by going on to moodle and reading what the assignment was and what the requirements were.
- I then came up with a concept and found a picture I wanted to use for the assignment.
- Then I began my project and if I came across any issues I referenced the course website and google.
- Once completed I submitted my links to moodle.
