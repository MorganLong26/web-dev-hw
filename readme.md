# My Intro-Web-Dev Homework Repo
## Morgan Long
I chose to take this class because I have never dealt with coding before, and I was curious. It interested me how a person could type a word or two, or even hit a symbol key and that created a paragraph, header, link, etc. I know a person that runs the website for MCPS and they more so work on a shell, so they don't get into the meat of making a website. Such as, the coding that goes into the website. It is amazing to learn the process of making a website from scratch. This class is a requirement for me to get my degree, but I was happy to take it because of the previous reasons listed above.
- The internet was the result of another project called ARPANET, which was a Department of Defense research project.
- This is no central control for the internet, but rather independently operated networks.
- Computers that people use are called clients not servers because they are not directly connected to the internet. They are connected to a service provider.
- The internet is just a wire in the ground.
