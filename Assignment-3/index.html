<h1>Chocolate Clouds</h1>
<q> <b>A light and airy pastry puff, filled with a chocolate mousse and dusted with
powdered sugar. Hmmm-hmm good! </b> </q>
<hr />

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<hr />
<ul>
<li><b><i>1 (17.3 ounce)</i></b> package frozen puff pastry (such as Pepperidge FarmÂ®), thawed</li>
<li><b><i>1 (3.9 ounce)</i></b> package instant chocolate pudding mix</li>
<li><b><i>1 cup</i></b> low-fat milk</li>
<li><b><i>1/2 (8 ounce)</i></b> container frozen whipped topping, thawed</li>
<li><b><i>1 tablespoon</i></b> confectioners' sugar for dusting, or to taste</li>
</ul>


<h2>Directions</h2>
<hr />
<ol>
<li>Preheat oven to <b> <i>400 degrees F (200 degrees C)</i></b>.</li>
<li>Unfold both sheets of puff pastry and lay onto a lightly floured work surface. Cut each sheet into 3 strips along the fold marks, then cut each strip into 4 squares to make 12 pastry squares per sheet. Place squares onto a baking sheet.</li>
<li>Bake in the preheated oven until the puff pastry is golden brown, about <b><i>15 minutes</i></b>. Let squares cool completely.</li>
<li>Whisk pudding mix and milk in a bowl until thick and smooth, about <b><i>1 minute; let stand about 3 minutes</i></b> to finish thickening. Gently fold whipped topping into pudding. Transfer chocolate mousse mixture into a pastry bag fitted with a medium tip.</li>
<li>Use a finger or a butter knife to gently open a corner of a pastry square. Make a small pocket in the pastry with the knife. Pipe about 1 tablespoon of chocolate mousse into the opening; a small amount of mousse will appear at the opening site when the pastry pocket is full. Repeat with remaining pastry squares and mousse mixture. Dust pastries lightly with confectioners' sugar.</li>
</ol>
