# README.MD

1. DIV's allow developers to block or group elements together. They can be alone or together. Classes are used to identify and select specific values and elements. ID's is a specific name to identify a specific element and its the global identifier. Spans are like dividers. Anything within the DIV is only going to happen in that particular DIV.

2. Alt text is an attribute for the visually impaired, so what ever text you enter behind that key the computer will read.

## Work Cycle

- I began by going to the course website and looking through all of the tabs of new information.
- Then I looked at the assignment and began the set up process.
- After the set up I proceeded into the meat of the project. I chose the song Location by Khalid.
- I ran into issues get just the audio but I eventually figured out a way just to get the audio embedded.
- The last portion of the assignment involving the .mp4 and .webm I completed, but there wasn't enough room to fit on the web page so I just blocked them out. I tested both and they work they just didn't fit, so they look like notes if you open my index.html in atom.
- Lastly, I completed the readme and uploaded everything to GitHub and the links to moodle.
